    "Through this analysis of NBA player’s statistics, we hope to answer to following questions: Can we accurately predict how many seasons it takes for an NBA rookie shooting guard to reach his prime? Will he breakout? Can we predict how long their career will last in the league? We believe that drawing from the stats of points (PTS), rebounds (REB), assists (AST), steals (STL), blocks (BLK), field goals attempted (FGA), field goals made (FGM), free throws attempted (FTA), free throws made (FTM), turnovers (TO), and minutes played, we will be able to create a performance rating that will lead us to conclude that rookies will take 4-6 years to breakout and reach their prime. We will also take the team that they are drafted to into account. \n",
    " \n",
    "This question is of interest because it will help us better speculate what players to keep an eye on, and whether NBA rookie statistics can be extrapolated to analyze when a rookie will breakout. Personal background includes our experience as fans of the sport and our support for the NBA. We have watched over five seasons of basketball, and in doing so have seen players mature from their rookie seasons to their primes. Additionally, we have absorbed knowledge from analysts and other sports media that make us believe that we can make an accurate prediction on how long it will take a rookie to reach his prime after 4-6 years of being in the league. \n"

    "After inputting the data and obtaining an efficiency rating for each player for each year, we were able to calculate an average efficiency rating for each season. From this, we see that each year, the average efficiency rating hovers around 115 with a standard deviation of about 30. This high standard deviation was expected do to the obvious skill differences between some of the league's best players and its worst players. Our research technique aimed to fit our efficiency rating to a regression analysis that showed data correlation in multiple players, and matched expectations about timing of All-Star player breakout.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kobe, Nash, and Parker had steep historic breakouts that our resulting data corroborates. Compared to per year league averages of efficiency, these high performing players broke out even if they had higher efficiency rating, than league averages, from the start. Tony Parker started out with an efficiency rating of 140, which far higher than league averages that sit between 100 and 120, and still showed a personal breakout that lead to peak performance during his first 6 years in the league according to our rating algorithm. However, this quick improvement from the start also stems from the fact that Parker played in the Euro league before entering the NBA, but this still does not take away from Parker's peak occurring about 5 years after he started playing basketball professionally, which is also the mark of the beginning of his championship runs with the Spurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In comparison to those great players, some current players such as, Lou Williams, Eric Gordon, and John Wall can be analyzed by looking at their stats for the time they have been in the league. They have gathered enough playing time, over five seasons at least, to show their progression throughout the years. For instance, Lou Williams started the league slowly but progressed to rise above the league average ER and has been steadily playing at that level in the past five years. Another example is his current teammate, Eric Gordon, who entered the league in 2008. The regression model seen is opposite to Lou Williams, as Eric Gordon's rookie years were about 20 points above the league average for efficiency rating (ER), but the later years show otherwise. His level of stellar play does not translate in his next four years of his career, which his ER is similar to the league average. A great comparison of the model to show how a superstar is on the rise is seen with John Wall. Given that his data only ranges for about six years, the quadratic regression models shows he is soon to be, or currently playing in his prime by having spectacular numbers that are way above the league average ER. \n",
    "\n",
    "The resultant data gathered and displayed on our linear, cubic, and quadratic regression lines shows a bell-shaped curve of efficiency rating throughout the player's NBA career. Our quadratic regression displays break-out and drop off trends of players as they age in the league. The regression of All-Star guards Kobe Bryant and Steve Nash shows an even more distinct regression curve that has a visibly strong break-out, based on our efficiency algorithm, and prolonged prime years of play. The qualitative data of historic breakout in these All-Star players, was matched by our quantitative data research shown in the regression curve. Each player that was analyzed showed some increase in efficiency rating upon onset of their first NBA season. Each player that was analyzed also showed some peak performance that fell between 4 and 10 years. This supports our hypothesis stating observable player breakout after 4 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we matched this with regressions of other young players that have been in the league less than 5 years to be compared to the first 5 years of Kobe and Nash. Lou Williams showed a definite breakout over a period of six years, with very steep initial spike in performance in his first two years of play. Regression analysis shows an early breakout, relative to average players in the league, for Lou after just his first two years.\n"

    "Our data was obtained from an official NBA source that provides us with a high confidence in data accuracy. Though we were successfully able to show a steep climb in NBA rookies early on, we also recognize that our efficiency rating algorithm has confounds implicit to it's design. Our research frame, that is based on famously high performing NBA guards, may have minimal bias in player choice of Kobe Bryant and Steve Nash. However, they are indisputably high performing athletes that are historically attributed with steep rookie breakout performance so we chose those players specifically. The algorithm is based on accurate player data but there is much valid argument for which statistics are most important in performance. Our research design focused on evenly distributing weight among the positive player statistic values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some errors we ran into in our project were the multiple datasets, each with different statistics that are calculated differently. Thus we resorted to using the most useful dataset, 'NBAPlayerPPG.csv', which has all the statistics to calculate a simple model. A confound that can be said about our calculations, were using the league averages for each category when it does not account for the outliers which may be players that do not put a lot of stats up versus superstars that exceed those averages by a lot. Comparing the rookies was unfeasible because of the multiple dataset issue, but using linear regression models on Kobe Bryant, Tony Parker, and Steve Nash demonstrated to us the breakout in their career when our calculated efficiency rating (ER) exceeded the league average ER by far. Being able to visualize the progression of their careers gives us an understanding of how a player develops their game, and also a way to implement a predictive model for rookies and how their beginning years compared to very accomplished players. Further improvements to this project would include the use of NBA Rookie Data as intended in the proposal, to project their careers based on the performance in their first five years in the league.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, our research data came from highly accurate sources, and all associated bias in design was minimal. We are happy to see regression data that matches our original hypothesis of a 4-6 year rookie breakout period. We also believe that current rookies will see a predictable breakout period in efficiency rating despite the many ways the NBA has changed in the last two decades. It is interesting to note that league average for our efficiency rating has shown a steady decrease since 1990. This may be attributable to a change in specific player statistic focus over the past two decades. Different statistics, such as those that track three point shooting, may have disproportionate weights in efficiency rating. Certain statistics may have more training focus in recent years, that may skew efficiency rating for those individual data variable types."
